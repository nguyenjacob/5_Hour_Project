# 5_Hour_Project

This is my repository for the pre-holiday 5 hour coding project. I wanted to get into trying to create more game codes using python, so I watched a lot of videos about certain functions and imports that work well with games.

The game works just as I wanted to, but there was this weird glitch with the ball that I couldn't fix where the ball randomly accelerates and decelerates and random points in time when bouncing around. The code uses turtle to create the visual looks of pong and so the paddles and the ball can actually move across the screen. This was also my first time using key presses for user interaction which was easier than I thought it would have been. I wanted to add an AI to play against, but I could not figure out how to get a bot to be able to move up and down to hit the moving ball.
